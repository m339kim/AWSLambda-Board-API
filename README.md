## Tools Utilized
This RESTful API is fully written in JavaScript. It is built using AWS API Gateway and AWS Lambda, with a MongoDB backend server; enabling information to be stored persistently in an online database. A Mongoose layer was installed and added to the API to configure the database connection. For testing purposes, a Google Chrome Extension Talend API Tester was used. Further demonstrations will be in this documentation! <br />
